A multi-user authentication system  (user-type -> user, admin).

Note: An industry professional will check the systems. No pressure. Its to ensure maximum participation.

- Use SQL database (mysql, postgresql, oracle for example)
- Create a database named "project-one"
- Build an API that’s reliable and well implemented.
- Build a Front-end in React.
- Connect the Two.
- You should spend minimum 3 hours/day * 7 = 21 hours minimum developing.
- You should finish the task by 06/02/2022.
- Keep things minimal. No extra features.
Normal User

Create a login/signup page where a user can signup and log in ( Table Name: users ). Frontend and Backend Validation should be there.

1. Email, Password, First Name, Re-enter password for the Signup page.
2. Email, Password for SignIn Page.
3. Email Verification should be there. You can use mailtrap for emails here.
4. If the user is successfully registered and verified his email then after login redirect him to the welcome page which should display "Hello user-name".
5. There should a logout button on the top right on a Navigation bar.

Admin User

1. Create a user using the signup page and change the user type of a user to "admin" in the database.
2. Now if a user is an admin he should redirect to Admin Dashboard after log in where he can see the list  of all registered users (List should show Email, Name, user-type, verified / Not Verified )
Optional: You can also use any template or theme like AdminLTE ( Import Properly )

Submission: You have to Push the code onto a GitHub Repository name it appropriately. Make a short video of < 10 mins to demonstrate the task. You have to show the functionality and show the database structure as well in the video.
